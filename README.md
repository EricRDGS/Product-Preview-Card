## Overview

This challenge was very interesting for me, because it is simple for a beginner and because it uses a css property that I am learning which is display: flex and also because of the responsiveness.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Continued development

I want to dig deeper into flexbox and maybe a little grid, I want to improve my general code and learn more about responsive.
